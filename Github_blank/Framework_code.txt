This project had two main components: spectral line refitting and physical quantity derivation. These two files are the culmination of the entire projects that contains the 
framework code that was used in this project to produce metallicity values in NGC 4254, as well as the other 18 PHANGS-MUSE galaxies. This code is generalized to analyze other galaxies
in the Nebular catalog for future use on other galaxies that also contain data from the SITELLE spectrograph at the CFHT. 

**INIT_LR_SITELLE** This file contains the initial line refitting code for MUSE-PHANGS galaxies with SITELLE data. Faint emission lines, also known as auroral lines, are refitted 
to obtain flux values. The four auroral lines are [OII]7319,7330, [NII]5755, and [SIII]6312. Orgininally the background continuum was not subtracted in the Nebular catalog, so in 
this notebook I fit the auroral lines with a normal gaussian with a constant offset to account for the background continuum. The error in these measurements are calculated using 
monte carlo techniques.
