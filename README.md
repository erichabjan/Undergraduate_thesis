# Undergraduate_thesis
My undergraduate thesis project used data from the PHANGS-MUSE Nebular catalog to directly derive the electron densities, temperatures and metallicities in the HII regions of NGC 4254. I have two files in this repository: Framework_code and Sandboxes. The Framework_code file presents the code that I used to derive the results of the project and the Sandboxes file presents the code that I used to plot data, refine methods and understand the packages that I was using.
