These are notebooks in which I **test** code and learn how to work with the data and packages I need for my analysis. 

**LineRefitting_Sandbox.ipynb** I test code to fit the auroral lines from the PHANGS Nebular catalog and obtain new flux values. These auroral lines include [OII]7319,7330, [NII]5755 and [SIII]6312. 

**met_sandbox.ipynb** I test code to produce ionic and elemental oxygen abundances using the PyNeb package.
